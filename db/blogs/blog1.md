# Tali Featured in CMUSE
#### September 21, 2020

Thanks a bunch to [CMUSE.org](https://www.cmuse.org/learn-recorder-lessons-online/) for choosing me to be a part of their top selection of 15 Websites To Learn Recorder Online. There are a lot of great resources there and it's an honor to be featured among them. My site is less than 6 months old at the time of writing this article, and it's great that people are finding it useful, I had no idea if anyone would ever see it!

To get started with the basics, feel free to checkout my [Tutorials](https://www.talirecorderlessons.com/tutorials) page and get some short lessons on the fundamentals of the recorder. Once you feel comfortable with that material, you can [book a free trial lesson with me](https://www.talirecorderlessons.com/book-lesson) and we can work through things more in depth.

I look forward to teaching you soon!
