            looking for a music teacher who took the recorder seriously! Not
            only did Tali teach my son how to play and experiment with the
            various recorder sizes, she introduced him to many new musical
            genres, and she encouraged him to compose. My son was so inspired,
            he continues to compose and this spring wrote a piece for the NY
            Philharmonic orchestra! Tali's patience and generosity of
            spirit is remarkable. She teaches with warmth, humor, and great
            flexibility."
